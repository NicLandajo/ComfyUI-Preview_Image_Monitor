# Preview Image Monitor is a powerful ComfyUI custom node that enables real-time image preview on any monitor connected to your system.
It displays your generated images in full-screen with professional-grade viewing controls including adjustable fit modes
(fit, fill, 1:1, letterboxing, pillarboxing, etc.), exposure/gamma/saturation adjustments. Select one of up to six secondary monitors.

Future improvements and Ideas for the node:

- Workflow Node Image cache/buffer: preview and compare outputs from any node in your workflow using hotkeys.

- Multi-Node Quadrant View: Monitor up to four different node outputs simultaneously by dividing the preview window into 4 dedicated quadrants.

- Adding  1366 √ó 768,  2560 √ó 1440  and  1536 √ó 864  resolutions.
