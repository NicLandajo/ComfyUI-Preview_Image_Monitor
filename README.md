# Preview Image Monitor is a powerful ComfyUI node that enables real-time image preview on any monitor connected to your system. Designed for digital artists and AI image generation workflows, it displays your generated images in a persistent, full-screen window with professional-grade viewing controls including adjustable fit modes (fit, fill, stretch, etc.), exposure/gamma/saturation adjustments, and multi-monitor support—all without interrupting your creative process.

Future improvements and Ideas for the node:

- A/B Comparison Tool: Directly compare two images or node outputs to quickly evaluate different prompts, seeds, or settings.

- Universal Workflow Monitor: Visualize the output of any node in your workflow directly on your screen, eliminating the need to route images to out-of-sight parts of your graph.

- Multi-Node Quadrant View: Monitor up to four different node outputs simultaneously by dividing the preview window into dedicated quadrants.

- Adding  1366 × 768,  2560 × 1440  and  1536 × 864  resolutions.
